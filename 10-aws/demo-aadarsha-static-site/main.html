            DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is about cultural change, collaboration, and a focus on automation, with the goal of increasing an organization's speed to deliver applications and services.

            Key principles of DevOps include continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous feedback. By breaking down the silos between development and operations teams, organizations can improve efficiency and release software more frequently and reliably.
